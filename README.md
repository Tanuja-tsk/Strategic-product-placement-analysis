 Product Positioning & Sales Analysis (Tableau Project)

 Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of product positioning on sales performance and consumer behavior using Tableau dashboards and stories.

The goal is to understand how product placement (endcap, aisle, shelf), pricing, promotions, and consumer demographics influence sales volume.

 

Data Preparation

The dataset was prepared before visualization by:

* Cleaning missing or irrelevant data
* Organizing data into structured format
* Standardizing values and categories
* Exploring trends and relationships
* Filtering relevant data for analysis

 


 Visualizations Created

* Sales by Product Position
* Impact of Promotions on Sales
* Sales by Consumer Demographics
* Price vs Competitor Price Analysis
* Seasonal vs Non-Seasonal Sales Comparison

A Tableau Story was created to present insights in a structured format.

 Deployment

The dashboard was published using Tableau and integrated into a Bootstrap-based website.

 Conclusion

The project demonstrates how product placement, pricing strategy, promotions, and customer demographics directly affect sales performance. The insights can help businesses optimize product positioning and marketing strategies.
